							<h1 class="major">Hypothesis Testing</h1>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Our main hypothesis of interest was whether or not there is a linear relationship between attributes of an artist’s tweets and the popularity of the song they are tweeting about on Spotify.
							</p>
							<p><b>Null hypothesis:</b> There is a linear relationship between the number of favorites and retweets all the tweets about a song has, the song’s release date on Spotify, and the popularity of that song on Spotify. 
							</p>
							<p><b>Alternative hypothesis:</b> There is not a linear relationship between the number of favorites and retweets all the tweets about a song has, the song’s release date on Spotify, and the popularity of that song on Spotify.
							</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">In order to test this hypothesis, we first had to go through all of an artist’s tweets and find all of the ones about each of their songs. In order to find the tweets about a song, we counted how many of the words in the song title the tweet contained. If the song title was less than 3 words, we required that all 3 words were present. We chose this because of songs with stop words such as “The Owl” - the identifying word is “owl”, so we must make sure the word “owl” is in the tweet. However, if the song had greater than 3 words, we allowed there to be only half of the words present in the tweet - we made this choice due to the abbreviations that people often use on Twitter. We also chose to ignore parts of the song title in parentheses, for cases such as “(with YoungBoy Never Broke Again)”. Once we had this information, we were able to calculate the number of tweets about each song, along with the total number of favorites and retweets all of those tweets received. We created a scatterplot of total number of favorites vs the album popularity to get a glimpse of the relationship between a tweet’s outreach and a song’s popularity. The graph shows that there does not seem to be a very clear relationship between the total number of favorites and album popularity, especially when the number of favorites is very low.

							<p style="text-indent: 40px"> We chose to test this hypothesis using linear regression. However, before performing the regression, we had to create a new categorical column called “days_since_release” which contains the number of days since 10/04/2019, the date when we pulled the data. We did this because Spotify calculates “album popularity” based on how recently people listened to the music, which would bias our results to more recently released music. Since our goal is to see if how much artists promote their music on Twitter is correlated with their album popularity, we have to take the date of release into account. One of the assumptions of linear regression is that the data is normal, so we used the Shapiro Wilk test to test the normality of our data. The test resulted in a p-value of 0, meaning that we have evidence the data is not normal. Therefore, we also had to normalize the data before running the linear regression. The resulting regression equation was Album Popularity = 39.61 + 19.574(Number of Favorites) - 58.211(Number of Retweets)  - 8.573(Days Since Release) with an Adjusted R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.06. The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> tells us the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that the independent variables collectively explain. Therefore, this regression equation tells us that our independent variables about Twitter do not explain a song’s popularity on Spotify well.
							</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">We wanted to see if we would get similar results using classification models that classified album popularity based on the number of tweets, total favorites, total retweets, and days since the release of the song on Spotify. The first time we predicted the song’s popularity to the exact ranking. This resulted in models with extremely low accuracy scores. Since the accuracy scores were so low, we decided to try again using album popularity as a binary variable, where 1 is “popular” (ranking > 50) and 0 is “unpopular” (ranking <= 50). We chose 50 as this is the halfway point. This resulted in much higher accuracy scores, and the models differed in accuracy scores by less than 2%. Both the Decision Tree Classifier and Naive Bayes resulted in an accuracy score of 69.49% and K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest resulted in 67.79% accuracy. This can be interpreted as 69.49% of the time, the Decision Tree Classifier or Naive Bayes model can accurately predict whether or not a song is “popular” on Spotify given the number of tweets, amount of favorites and retweets those tweets received, and the days since the release of the song. The classification report for K-Nearest neighbors shows that the precision for predicting unpopularity was 62% and the precision for predicting popularity was 73%. For the Decision Tree Classifier, the precision for predicting unpopularity was 68% and the precision for predicting popularity was 88%. This means that this Decision Tree Classifier model can predict popularity more precisely than K-Nearest Neighbors. The confusion matrix [[24  2]
[17 16]] shows that the Decision Tree model predicted true positives 24 times and only false positives twice.
							</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">We created an ROC curve of the Decision Tree Classifier, which shows that our model performs better than random guessing. The AUC tells us that the probability our model ranks a random positive example more highly than a random negative example is 71%.

							<p style="text-indent: 40px">After getting a relatively high accuracy score for predicting popularity in a binary way, we wanted to see if we could get a similar accuracy rate for predicting popularity in bins of 20 (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100). The K-Nearest Neighbors model resulted in the highest accuracy score with 47.06% followed by the Decision Tree Classifier model at 45.1%. By binning popularity, we lost 22% accuracy in predicting popularity.
							</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Testing our hypothesis that the more favorites and retweets an artist’s tweets about a new song gets, the higher the song’s popularity will be on Spotify showed us that there is not as high of a correlation as we predicted. It seems as though artists who have a very high number of Twitter followers also have very high popularity on Spotify. However, we cannot conclude confidently that the exact outreach of a tweet has an impact on the success of a new song or album. That said, our results still show that it is important to have a presence on Twitter overall, which contributes to our understanding of online promotion in the music industry.
