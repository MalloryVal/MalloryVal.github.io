							<p>The various analyses we conducted made clear that the relationship between music popularity on Spotify and artist behavior on Twitter is much more layered than we initially thought. We could not decisively conclude that self-promotion on Twitter produced greater popularity for artists on Spotify as we had predicted. Because of this result, we do not have enough evidence to claim that there is any proven benefit to tweeting promotional material in order to increase streams on Spotify. However, we were able to highlight a significant correlation between these two groups of attributes. Although we could not prove causation, we could establish that those artists who are successful on Twitter are most often also successful on Spotify. This association, primarily evidenced in our Pearson Correlation Coefficient analysis, indicates that popularity on these two platforms are certainly related. What remains to be studied is the potential for lurking variables in this relationship. Perhaps artists with a large following on Twitter have a higher net worth and can afford more widespread advertising campaigns when they release their music; this could account for their increased success on Spotify.
Several of our other analyses indicated potential factors that could also play a role in an artistâ€™s success on Spotify. For example, our clustering analysis highlighted that musical qualities of tracks and artists are also related to their popularity. Attributes like energy and tempo seem to be relatively similar across current popular tracks, and this realization proves that Twitter promotion alone is certainly not enough to become successful in the music industry. After all, not all music-streamers are Twitter users. There is no denying that social media is an important tool for artists to engage with their fans, but the nature of music consumption has clearly not been entirely redefined by social media. 
Although our findings did not conclusively support self-promotion on Twitter as a means to increase artist popularity on Spotify, they did demonstrate an important relationship that is likely to increase in prominence in the coming years. It will be fascinating to track this relationship over time to assess the way these two powerful platforms continue to interact with each other in years to come.
