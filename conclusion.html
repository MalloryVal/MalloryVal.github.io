							<h1 class="major">Conclusion</h1>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Although our findings did not conclusively support that an artist who has more reach on Twitter will be more popular on Spotify, they did demonstrate an important relationship that is likely to increase in prominence in the coming years. Our data showed that a larger online social media presence often means a more popular artist. We believe that as the world grows more and more digital, it will only become more important for an artist to have a strong social media presence. However, our findings also indicate that the quality of music is still important: people will respond to good music.
							</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">It is also important for companies like Spotify to remain unbiased is choosing who they feature on Spotify. If artists begin to pay to be featured, it would undermine the level playing field that social media seems to create in allowing artists to develop a grassroots following using the power of social mediaâ€™s outreach. It will be fascinating to track the relationship between social media and Spotify over time to assess the way these two powerful platforms continue to interact with each other in years to come.
