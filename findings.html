							<p style="text-indent: 40px">The various analyses we conducted made clear that the relationship between music popularity on Spotify and artist behavior on Twitter is much more layered than we initially thought. We could not decisively conclude that self-promotion on Twitter produced greater popularity for artists on Spotify as we had predicted. Because of this result, we do not have enough evidence to claim that there is any proven benefit to tweeting promotional material in order to increase streams on Spotify. However, we were able to highlight a significant correlation between these two groups of attributes. Although we could not prove causation, we could establish that those artists who are successful on Twitter are most often also successful on Spotify. This association, primarily evidenced in our Pearson Correlation Coefficient analysis, indicates that popularity on these two platforms are certainly related. What remains to be studied is the potential for lurking variables in this relationship. Perhaps artists with a large following on Twitter have a higher net worth and can afford more widespread advertising campaigns when they release their music; this could also account for their increased success on Spotify.
							</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">That said, we did uncover significant evidence that artists use Twitter to promote their music, as well as the kind of promotion they favor on this platform. Our topic modeling produced compelling evidence that a significant proportion of the content on musical artists’ Twitter accounts is promotional in nature. Since six of the fifteen topics generated by LDA have to do with music promotion, it is safe to assume that artists who have recently released music on Spotify will take advantage of Twitter to promote it. Additionally, our word cloud proved that artists most often promote their new albums by providing informational content about them on Twitter, rather than directly encouraging fans to buy and stream. Knowing this gave us a better idea of what we were referring to when discussing “promotional tweets.”
							</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Several of our other analyses indicated potential factors that could also play a role in an artist’s success on Spotify. For example, our clustering analysis highlighted that musical qualities of tracks and artists are also related to their popularity. Attributes like energy and tempo seem to be relatively similar across current popular tracks, and this realization proves that Twitter promotion alone is certainly not enough to become successful in the music industry. After all, not all music-streamers are Twitter users. There is no denying that social media is an important tool for artists to engage with their fans, but the nature of music consumption has clearly not been entirely redefined by social media.
