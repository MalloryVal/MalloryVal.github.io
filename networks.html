							<p>Network analysis allowed us to explore the connections between artists that occur in different genres. Nodes were coloured according to the amount of tweets released about their featured albums. We hoped to highlight the similarities between artists in similar genres with regards to promotion on twitter. In the network that is colored by cluster, we found that there were 17 different clusters. The modularity of the clustering was 0.47 indicating that there was some overlap between clusters, and suggests that many artists belong to more than one genre.</p>

							<p>In the graph showing the network colored by number of promotional tweets, there are 449 nodes and 9436 edges. The density of the graph is 0.09. This is a relatively high density, when compared with many sparse real world networks, that indicates that the graph has 9% of the possible connections it could. Additionally, there are 9 connected components in the network and the largest connected component is 383 nodes. This indicates that out of the 449 artists in the network, most of them are connected to each other in some way. This connected component contains mostly artists in the rap and pop genres. The remaining 66 artists make up 8 of the connected components and belong to obscure genres. The artist Grimes, the max degree node, is located in the largest connected component and has 154 edges.  The average degree is 41.8 showing that most of the artists have a large number of connections to others. The average clustering coefficient of the network is 0.79, with Surfaces being the node with the max clustering coefficient of 1.0. This suggests tight clusters where many nodes are inter connected. This graph also indicates that artists in the same genre have varied twitter habits, as there is no majority color in any of the clusters. This suggested that twitter promotion was similar across genres and indicating that there is no genre effect on twitter behavior.</p>
