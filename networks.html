							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Here we created a network where the nodes are artists and they are connected to each other if they are in any of the same musical genres. The nodes were colored according to the number of tweets the artist released about their featured albums. We hoped to highlight the similarities between artists in the same genres with regards to promotion on Twitter. However, the graph shows that artists in the same genre have varied Twitter habits, as there is no majority color in any of the clusters. This suggests that Twitter promotion can be similar across genres and indicates that there is no specific genre effect on Twitter behavior.

							<p style="text-indent: 40px">The network shown above is the same graph but the nodes are colored by cluster. We found that there were 17 different clusters and the modularity of the clustering was 0.47. This indicates that there was some overlap between clusters, and suggests that many artists belong to more than one genre.
							</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">In the graph, there are 449 nodes and 9436 edges. The density of the graph is 0.09. This is a relatively high density, when compared with many sparse real world networks, that indicates that the graph has 9% of the possible connections it could have. Additionally, there are 9 connected components in the network and the largest connected component is 383 nodes. This indicates that out of the 449 artists in the network, most of them are connected to each other in some way. This connected component contains mostly artists in the rap and pop genres. The remaining 66 artists make up 8 of the connected components and belong to obscure genres. The artist Grimes has the maximum degree of 154 edges and is located in the largest connected component. The average degree is 41.8 showing that most of the artists have a large number of connections to others. The average clustering coefficient of the network is 0.79, with the artist Surfaces being the node with the maximum clustering coefficient of 1. This suggests tight clusters where many nodes are interconnected.
