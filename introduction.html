							<p style="text-indent: 40px">With the prevalence of social media in today’s world, there is a perception that a musical artist’s online presence is a critical step toward building a solid fanbase. Social media seems to have allowed smaller artists to gain a grassroots following and grow their communities of supporters. Larger artists are able to promote their music through their social media channels. However, it is not currently known how important an artist’s social media presence is in establishing a career and a following. Our goal is to discover if there is any truth behind the perceived importance of social media and aim to look at whether the reach of the online presence of an artist correlates to the popularity of their music as measured by its ranking on Spotify. The answer to this question would provide meaningful insight to artists and producers in terms of where they should focus their efforts when trying to grow their fan base.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">According to Andy Greenberg’s Forbes article (2009) “Why Celebrities Twitter,” the prominence of social media platforms has a lot to do with the appeal of taking an insider’s glimpse into the celebrity community. He notes that 20 of the top 100 feeds on Twitter are written by “real-world celebrities” whether those feeds be promotional in nature or every-day commentary. Regardless of the content of these tweets, it is evident that Twitter provides public figures with a convenient tool to transmit their voices to a large audience at the click of a button.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Musicians such as Bobby Owsinski have even published comprehensive manuals for artists to give them the insight they need to use social media to its full potential. His book "Social Media Promotion for Musicians: The Manual for Marketing Yourself, Your Band and Your Music Online" (Owsinski, 2017) claims to hold all the tricks and tips to boost streams, views, and followers for those in the music community. Guides like these emphasize the crucial nature of promotional tweeting techniques, hinting that success is less about the quality of content and more about the way that content is marketed. Owsinski’s book (2017) even claims to hold “the secret behind successful posts and tweets for maximum engagement”, much of which has to do with key-words, the timing of posts, and the curation of a personal “brand” through strategic imagery and dialogue. However, little research has been conducted to confirm the efficacy of these specific techniques, particularly within the international music industry.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Understanding how, when, and where artists use Twitter to promote their music is not only useful for those musicians seeking to improve their sales, but also for consumers. Media technology scholars Alice Marwick and Danah Boyd (2011) point out the complex relationship between celebrities and their fans in their article To See and Be Seen: Celebrity Practice on Twitter. They argue that “while celebrity practice is theoretically open to all, it is not an equalizer or democratizing discourse. Indeed, in order to successfully practice celebrity, fans must recognize the power differentials intrinsic to the relationship” (Marwick & Boyd, 2011). It is essential to acknowledge that while social media might appear to level the playing field between artists and consumers, it is still a channel through which consumer habits can be influenced and manipulated. By taking a closer look at the social media of those who are featured on Spotify, we hope to inform both consumers and producers about different strategies employed and their outcomes.</p>
