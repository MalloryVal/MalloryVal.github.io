							<h1 class="major">Data</h1>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Our datasets are sourced from the Spotify API and the Twitter API. The Spotify data is composed of three primary datasets and three supplementary datasets. The first primary dataset is the top 100 new featured albums from six majority English-speaking marketplaces, five majority Spanish-speaking market places and one country with no large majority language (South Africa). From these albums, we created another dataset of all the artists and their corresponding information, including a list of their top ten tracks. The number of artists in our dataset ended up being 463. Another one of our core Spotify datasets is information about each of these artists’ top ten tracks and the tracks on each of the featured albums. Our Twitter dataset contains the thirty most recent tweets from each of the featured Spotify artists who used Twitter along with metrics like number of followers, favorites and retweets. Overall, we collected 12,020 tweets from 406 artists.
							</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Several issues arose when we examined variables from both the Spotify data and the Twitter data. For example, when we collected the Twitter handles of artists who appear on the top charts, we realized that selecting the correct twitter handle was not always easy. Some artists have more than one Twitter account to reach audiences from different countries. Bands often have a group Twitter account plus individual accounts that correspond to each band member. These cases present dilemmas since different musicians might choose to promote their music more heavily on one account versus another, and it would be difficult to pinpoint these biases without analyzing the Twitter activity of each individual account. </p2>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">We also encountered issues when determining whether a Twitter account actually belongs to one of the artists from our Spotify dataset. Some artists do not have Twitter accounts, and others might not have amassed a large following yet, so it can be challenging to discern whether an account can be considered “official” or not. There are some promotional Twitter accounts that are run by fans, and some Twitter accounts which are run by artists but have not been verified. It will be important to highlight these drawbacks when analyzing the data since these factors could certainly sway our results even though they might not seem like obvious sources of bias.
							</p2>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">With regards to the Spotify API, we also ran into issues when attempting to pull the data. We found that we would need to do many different API calls to get the data we needed to answer our question. This meant that our Spotify API calls took over five hours to pull all the data and provided a barrier in allowing us to easily check and work with the data as we collected it.</p2>
