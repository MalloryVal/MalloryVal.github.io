							<h1 class="major">Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
							<p>When it came to calculating descriptive statistics for our key attributes, we noticed several important features of our data that later informed our choices of analyses. For some attributes, the distributions presented a particularly high level of skewness. Namely, ‘retweet_count’, ‘favorite_count’, ‘followers_count’ from Twitter, and ‘artist_followers’ from Spotify all present medians which are significantly lower than their means. This indicates that these attributes are significantly skewed to the right. In context, this makes sense since we expect that retweets, favorites, and followers will all contain high outliers due to the nature of fame on social media. Since these attributes are raw counts, we expect that they will exhibit more skewness when compared to the normalized attributes like Spotify’s ‘artist_popularity’.</p>
							<p>With regard to spread, we noticed that the largest values observed for standard deviation coincide with the attributes that are severely skewed-right. Specifically, ‘retweet_count’, ‘favorite_count’, ‘followers_count’, and ‘artist_followers’ present the highest degree of spread among the variables we have analyzed. Again, this is likely due to the presence of high outliers in these attributes.</p>
							<p>The attribute ‘album_release’, which denotes the date a specific album was first released, gives us an indication of the time period during which most of the tracks that we will analyze were released. With a mode of September 27, 2019 and a median of September 6, 2019, the center of this distribution falls in September of this year. Given that we collected our data based on the most popular tracks in mid-October, it makes sense that the most common release date of these tracks occurred about a month prior.</p>
							<p>We began our correlation analysis by developing scatterplots of all pairings among the following attributes: ‘artist_popularity’, ‘artist_followers’, and ‘followers_count’. Using the raw counts for followers on Twitter and Spotify against the normalized attribute ‘artist_popularity’ produced scatterplots that show what appear to be non-linear relationships. As ‘artist_popularity’ increases steadily, the follower counts increase sharply, leading us to conclude that these relationships were exponential. However, comparing the two follower count attributes produced what looks like a relatively linear relationship.</p>

							<p>Since the Pearson coefficient can only be used to quantify the strength of linear relationships, we decided to scale down the rather large ranges present in our two follower count attributes in a way that produced more linear relationships by using their fourth-root.Our analysis of the correlations between these three variables indicates that in general, ‘artist_popularity’, ‘artist_followers’, and ‘followers_count’ are all highly correlated. The Pearson correlation coefficients all ended up being greater than 0.6. In terms of ranking these relationships, ‘artist_popularity’ and ‘artist_followers’ produced the highest Pearson correlation coefficient (0.835753), indicating a very strong linear relationship. In context, this means that as ‘artist_popularity’ increases, the fourth-root of ‘artist_followers’ increases at a relatively constant rate. The linear relationship between ‘followers_count’ and ‘artist_popularity’ was the second strongest (0.680154). The third strongest linear relationship was between ‘artist_followers’ and ‘followers_count’ (0.628465).</p>
							<p>This tells us that an artist’s overall popularity on Spotify is more highly correlated with their follower count on Spotify than with their follower count on Twitter, but also that an artist’s follower count on Twitter is more highly correlated with their overall popularity on Spotify than with their follower count on Spotify. This is interesting since it indicates that the relationship between Spotify followers and Twitter followers is not as strong as we thought when compared to other relationships.
							</p>
							<p>We also created a scatterplot showing the album popularity versus the number of favorites on tweets mentioning that album. This graph indicated a very weak trend that as the album popularity increases the tweets relating to that album have more favourites. This provides a support for our hypothesis that the album promotion on twitter is correlated with streaming success on Spotify. </p>
