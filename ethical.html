							<h1 class="major">Limitations & Ethical Concerns</h1>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">It has been crucial to acknowledge the inherent limitations of our data as we have endeavored to extract meaning from it. First and foremost, the scope of our project is limited based on the fact that we have only integrated data from one social media site. Twitter, although typically ranked among the most important platforms for self-promotion (“How to Promote Your Music: The Essential Guide”, n.d.), cannot accurately represent the online presence of musical artists on its own. Instagram and Facebook are also important platforms used by this music community, and so our analysis only represents a slice of the phenomenon we are trying to describe. For this reason, our conclusions cannot be generalized to say whether self-promotion on social media impacts the popularity of music on Spotify. Rather, we can only draw conclusions within the scope of Twitter while recognizing that this may not be the primary platform for self-promotion for many artists.
              </p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Another constraint in our project lies in the limited number of tweets we extracted from each artist’s Twitter. We only pulled the thirty most recent tweets of each artist, so it is likely that we missed relevant tweets that were published prior to these thirty. If an artist is particularly active on Twitter, or if they use Twitter for strategic rollouts leading up to a big release, they probably had Tweets beyond their thirty most recent which mentioned their music or promoted an upcoming release. In this way, our data does not entirely reflect the scope of self-promotion on Twitter. In addition, we had to create our own method to find the tweets that were specifically about an artist’s song. While we are confident that our method works well, it is of course not perfect due to the fact that some songs have generic titles such as “Enjoy” and “I”. Therefore, we may have missed or inaccurately included some tweets.
              </p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">In addition, our interpretation of “popularity” of songs and artists is ambiguous due to the nature of Spotify’s API. Popularity is calculated by Spotify based on the total number of times the track, album, or artist has been played and how recent those plays are. However, we have little information about how is calculation is performed. Popularity in the music industry might also have to do with attributes like international renown (how many people listen to this artist in other countries?), industry recognition (how many awards has this artist won?), or streams per minute (how often is this artist streamed at a given time?). Since these factors and many others are not taken into account in our “popularity” attributes, we cannot fully conclude whether our interpretation of popularity is accurate or complete.
              </p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">With respect to ethical concerns resulting from our analysis, we found it important to consider the potential impact of our findings. Results about the benefit of high-reaching tweets on Twitter would likely be used by record labels, producers, PR teams, and artists to change the way they engage with their fanbase online. If we had concluded that high-reaching tweets on Twitter leads to greater popularity in the music industry, this could mean an increased quantity of paid-content on Twitter, use of bots to inflate metrics like retweets and favorites, and less organic engagement between artists and their fans. While our analysis does not appear to violate any ethical issues directly, it could certainly be utilized to bolster these questionable activities.
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 40px">Another concern of ours has to do with sourcing our data from Spotify. Although we do not take data directly from user accounts, it is their data which is used to calculate metrics like artist and album popularity. Spotify users might not be aware that their streaming habits are being used for studies like this, which could potentially impact their Twitter experience. If a Spotify user felt strongly that they do not want the artists they follow on Twitter to increase the promotional content on the platform, they would probably not want their data to be used in the study that is responsible for this trend. Ideally, Spotify users would be given the option to opt into these kinds of studies or be clearly notified that their use of the platform mandates their participation in studies like ours.
