							<p>We used cluster analysis and association mining to look at the differences between songs featured by spotify and the top songs of featured artists. Clustering analysis on the data revealed that the most effective clustering algorithm for the dataset was the k-means algorithm with k=5, as the silhouette value was the highest. This was supported by the PCA projection of the values. We then analysed the centroids of each attribute in a cluster and decided that each cluster was unique. Next, we performed a k-means clustering analysis of the featured songs and a k-means clustering analysis of the top songs for each artist that was featured. We wanted to know the characteristics of the most popular types of song compared to the characteristics of types of songs featured. We found a silhouette score of 0.18 for featured songs and 0.22 for top songs showing that the clusters for both top songs and featured songs had overlapping characteristics. We found that high danceability, energy and valence were common characteristics of both top and featured songs. We also found that Spotify tended to feature songs that were both high in acousticness and danceability, whereas top songs that we acoustic were only characterised by acousticness. Similarly, Spotify typically features songs high in just instrumentalness, but top songs that are high in instrumentalness are also high in energy.  Analysis also revealed that songs with high energy and tempo are more popular among listeners than only high energy songs featured by Spotify. Our analysis indicates that there is a distinct difference between typical songs featured by Spotify and typical top songs for each artist that is featured. Since Spotify features new songs, the difference in characteristics between the featured songs and top songs indicates that musical quality may be a factor in driving popularity, undermining our hypothesis that self promotion is the key to artist success.
