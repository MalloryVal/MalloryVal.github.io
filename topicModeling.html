							<h1 class="major">Topic Modeling using LDA TF-IDF</h1>
							
							<p style="text-indent: 40px"> We were curious if we could use topic modeling to locate the tweets that are specifically about promoting new songs and if more or less popular artists tweet about this topic the most. We chose to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to conduct topic modeling because even though tweets are short, we believe our sample of tweets does not contain a lot of noise as we are looking at a very specific set of tweets.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px"> We first preprocessed the tweets by tokenizing the sentences, removing stopwords, and reducing the words to their root forms. We also filtered out words that appeared less than 10 times or in more than 60% of the tweets. For each tweet, we created a bag of words and performed a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) transformation on the bag. We used TF-IDF because it reflects how relevant a word is in a given tweet. TF-IDF creates a weight that balances the number of times a word occurs in the tweet with how many times that word occurs among all of the tweets. Because all of our tweets are from musical artists, we knew there would most likely be words that appeared many times and therefore convey very little discriminating power. We then trained our LDA model on all of the tweets, creating 15 topics.</p>

							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Out of the 15 topics, there were 6 that we thought were strongly related to promoting new music: 2, 5, 8, 9 and 12. We used the boxplot of artist popularity to determine how we would characterize the most and least popular artists. We chose 77 and 52 because 25% of artists have a popularity ranking above and below these cutoffs. We chose to use artist popularity instead of number of Spotify followers because we believed it was a better measure of how often an artist’s music is listened to. This bar chart shows artists sorted by their popularity as calculated by Spotify. The bars are colored by number of followers and there is very slight variation in color until the top 5 most popular artists. Therefore, Spotify’s popularity measure gave us a much more specific indicator of how often an artist’s music is listened to.

							<p  style="text-indent: 40px">For each artist, we calculated how many of their tweets had a classification probability of higher than 85% for one of the six topics. We chose 85% because we wanted to be very confident these tweets were about our topic of interest. 48 out of 2276 tweets from the most popular artists fell into one of the topics that related to promoting new music (2: 15, 5: 3, 8: 9, 9: 7, 10: 11, 12: 3) and 36 out of 1581 tweets from the least popular artists fell into one of the topics (2: 7, 5: 11, 8: 3, 9: 4, 10: 8, 12: 3). Even though we pulled the last 30 tweets from each artist, there were some artists for whom we could not find Twitter accounts or who had fewer than 30 tweets, which explains the difference in the total tweet counts for each group.
							</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">Topic 2 turned out to be the most common category for the most popular artists. An example of a tweet that was classified into this topic is “Tomorrow I’ll be sharing a Behind The Scenes video for my new single ‘Be Honest’ via Shazam To Unlock! Check out my socials tomorrow for an exclusive look behind the scenes of the video!” This tweet by Jorja Smith was classified into Topic 2 with 88.33% probability. The most common category for least popular artists was Topic 5. An example of a tweet classified into Topic 5 is “My new song ‘Something New’ is being premiered TONIGHT on Goodnights. Tune in from 6pm. Hope u like this” This tweet from Tyne-James Organ was classified with 86.67% probability. Even though these example tweets are both great examples of the content we are interested in, only 2% of the tweets for both groups were about these topics (with 85% probability). Because both groups of tweets fall into our six promotional topics at the same rate, it appears that the popularity of an artist does not necessarily coincide with the promotional content on their Twitter. However, since most popular and least popular artists fall into different topics within these six, it could be the case that they employ different promotional strategies, which we explored further with a word cloud, shown below.</p>
							<center><a class="image object"><img src="images/word_cloud_cropped.png" alt="" style="width:500px;height:300px;"/></a></center>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">This word cloud allows us to better visualize the topics in tweets that mention an album. We found that many of the most prominent words were associated with promotion. For example the word ‘RT’ indicates that artists retweet promotional materials related to their album. In addition, the words ‘album’, ‘new’, ‘now’, ‘tonight’, ‘today’ and ‘listen’ are prominent in the word cloud, indicating that artists often promote the time of album release. Furthermore, the word cloud includes words such as ‘show’ and ‘ticket’, which indicates that artists are also promoting their tours when mentioning their albums. This word cloud largely indicates that album promotion does occur on Twitter and is the largest topic of conversation when referring to albums.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">The word cloud also provides insight as to the strategies employed on Twitter to promote musical albums. We had anticipated imperative verbs like ‘buy’ and ‘stream’ to be the most common in these tweets, since this would be the most direct way to encourage a positive reception toward new music. However, the most widespread imperative verb used was ‘RT’, implying that artists typically use Twitter to boost exposure within that platform before they encourage sales on streaming platforms like Spotify. Additionally, the high frequency of words like ‘today’, ‘tonight’, and ‘now’ seems to indicate that promotional tweets often serve an informational purpose leading up to a release. Rather than saying “buy my new music now,” most artists appear to favor gentler messages like “new album tonight at 11pm.” We can speculate that this strategy is employed by artists to ensure that their Twitter presence does not make their fan engagement come off as overly transactional, and so that fans continue to like the artists and not just their music.
